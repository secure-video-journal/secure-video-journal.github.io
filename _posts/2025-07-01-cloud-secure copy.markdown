Cloud storage shouldn’t feel like leaving your diary on a park bench. Yet headlines keep reminding us that *“in the cloud”* can mean *“everywhere.”*  
So what turns a plain cloud app into a **cloud-secure** one?

For us, it starts with a clear principle: **your private data never leaves our infrastructure, and no third party ever sees it.**

### 1. Encryption at Rest: Keys or It Didn’t Happen  

The gold-standard is **AES-256** encryption managed by cloud Key-Management Services (KMS).  
If someone grabs a hard-drive in a data-centre, they still see scrambled bytes — no key, no data.

*How we do it* → Server-side encryption (SSE-S3) with dedicated KMS keys; rotation every 12 months.

### 2. Encryption in Transit - TLS 1.3 as Table Stakes  

Every request travels through **TLS 1.3 with HSTS**.  
Older protocols (TLS 1.0/1.1) are disabled; certificate pinning in the mobile PWA blocks “coffee-shop” snooping.

### 3. Don’t Let Data Roam  

Privacy isn't just about encryption — it's about **control**.  
We never send raw or derived user content (like transcripts, mood scores, or embeddings) to third-party AI services, analytics platforms, or vector databases.  

APIs communicate **only** within a private VPC; model inference and analysis run entirely on our own infrastructure or directly in the browser.  
Logs strip PII and age out after 30 days. No external eyes. No silent data leaks.

### 4. Authentication ≠ Password  

* **2-Factor Auth** by default
* **Geo-lock** on admin logins  
* **Session lock-out** after 30 minutes idle

### 5. True Deletion - Not Just “Soft Delete”  

Click *Delete Entry* → object and transcript wiped from primary + replicated buckets, cryptographic key scheduled for hard delete after 7 days (user can undo within that window).

---

### 6. The Litmus Test  

Cloud-secure means: **if the vendor vanished tomorrow, your data would still be unreadable to anyone else.**  
No AI APIs holding embeddings. No analytics firms tracking behavior. Just secure storage you control.

Hold every service - ours included - to that bar.
