A tiny daily check-in can **lift mood, sharpen memory, and chart your growth**.  
Even five minutes is enough to trigger measurable gains.

### *1. Mood*

Randomised trials link just a few minutes of journaling to lower cortisol and reduced anxiety.<sup>[1](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun02/writing) [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30530460/)</sup>  
Moments of thanks matter, too: students who kept a **two-week gratitude log** reported brighter mood *and* higher academic motivation.<sup>[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33980290/)</sup>

> **Stat bar:** A 12-week “positive-affect journaling” program cut clinical anxiety by **22 %** compared with usual care.<sup>[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30530460/)</sup>

### *2. Memory & Focus*

Recording an experience forces the brain to *encode* it twice; once in the moment, again during review. This strengthens recall pathways.  Research in cognitive psychology consistently finds that multisensory note-taking (speaking aloud, sketching, handwriting) leads to deeper processing and better long-term recall than typing alone.

> **Take-away:** Describe, speak, or sketch what happened; engaging more senses helps tomorrow-you remember today’s insight.

### *3. The Self-Improvement Loop*

Consistency beats intensity. Behaviour-science research shows visible streaks boost persistence across everything from coding to exercise.<sup>[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02371)</sup> A simple calendar grid lets you **see the habit forming**, nudge-free.

Zooming out once a month - whether with a notebook summary or the *My Storyline* view of all your entries - turns those daily check-ins into SMART-goal checkpoints: what moved, what stalled, and what to adjust next. Done regularly, these micro-corrections compound into steady progress over time.

### *4. Creativity & Problem-Solving*

Stepping out of task mode and into *narrative mode* lights up the brain’s default-mode network. This is the same circuitry active during daydreaming and insight moments. Edison kept **3,500 notebooks** to trap ideas before they evaporated. Today, a 60-second video brainstorm can play the same role; review sparks connections you missed in real time.

### *Why video supercharges it*

Typed words capture the **what**. Video captures the **how**: tone, posture, and micro-expressions. Reviewing body language helps you recognise fatigue, confidence, or hesitation cues. It’s also faster; speaking ~150 wpm beats typing ~40 wpm.

### *Getting started in 5 minutes*

* **Set a timer for five minutes.** Stop when it buzzes.  
* **Use a prompt.** “What drained me / energised me today?”  
* **Record, don’t judge.** Treat it like a voice note to future-you.
