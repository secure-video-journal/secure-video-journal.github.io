Typed words capture **what** you said; video captures **how** you showed up.

### *Why non-verbal matters*  

Psychologists estimate most emotional meaning travels through tone, pauses, and body language, not the literal words.¹  
Strip those cues away and yesterday’s entry can feel flat or even misleading.

| 🎙 Voice tone | 😌 Micro-expressions | ⏸ Pauses & pace |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Conveys intent | Reveals hidden feeling | Flags hesitation or excitement |

More cues mean a richer record. Secure Video Journal extracts them automatically, building a **Storyline** that lets you track progress you can *feel* - entry by entry and month over month.

### *A 15-second proof of concept*  

<div style="display:flex;gap:1rem;flex-wrap:wrap">
  <!-- replace video-thumbnail.gif -->
  <img src="/assets/img/clip-thumbnail.gif" alt="15-sec video" style="width:300px">
  <!-- replace transcript-screenshot.png -->
  <img src="/assets/img/transcript-screenshot.png" alt="Transcript screenshot" style="width:300px">
</div>

**Take-away:** the transcript shows content, but it misses a laugh at 0 : 04, a three-second pause before naming a hard topic, and a shoulder-shrug that signals self-doubt.

### *Four cues we track automatically*  

Voice, face, and whole-body posture each carry different signals so Secure Video Journal listens to all four.

| # | Cue | Why it matters |
|---|-----|----------------|
| **1** | **Speaking pace & filler words** | Rapid pace plus spikes of *“um”* often signal nervous energy—or excitement. |
| **2** | **Facial micro-expressions** | A slight brow-furrow or half-smile can reveal emotions you haven’t yet named. |
| **3** | **Pause length & placement** | Long pauses just before a keyword highlight hesitation hotspots worth exploring. |
| **4** | **Body posture & gestures** | Slumped shoulders, fidgeting hands, or widened stance can signal fatigue, confidence, or stress even when your voice sounds steady. |

These cues land on an **Insight Strip** for each entry *and* feed the zoomed-out **Storyline**, so you see immediate moments *and* long-term patterns with no manual replay required.

### *My Storyline: the zoom-out view*

A single entry is useful but the real magic happens when every cue feeds into a living, colour-coded timeline. **My Storyline** plots mood, themes, and energy shifts across all your videos, so patterns jump out without re-watching a thing.

### *But is video still private?*  

Yes. Entries travel via **TLS 1.3** and rest under **AES-256 encryption** in our own secure buckets.  
Transcripts never leave that environment, and nothing is shared unless *you* create a time-limited link for a coach or therapist. You keep the keys.
